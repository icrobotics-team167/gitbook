# Band Saw

Band saws are tools often used to cut pieces to a specific size. Here are some safety guidelines with these.

1\) Keep your hand away from the blade. This is obvious but make sure to always keep your hand a safe distance as you need to guide the piece through the saw blade.

2\) Make sure to keep your face a safe distance from the blade. Now, because you need to guide a piece through the saw blade, you need to be able to see what you are doing. However, this doesn't mean to be unsafe with where you keep your face.&#x20;

3\) Make sure you don't have a dull saw blade. This is dangerous because dull blades can slip and cause an injury.

4\) Keep the machine off and unplugged when not in use.
