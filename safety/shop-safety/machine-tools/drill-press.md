# Drill Press

A drill press is very similar to a drill in function, but because it is a press, has some different safety guidlines.

1\) Never put your hand near the drill bit.&#x20;

2\) Make sure to keep the piece secure.

3\) Keep your face out of the way of the drill. This is to avoid debris from hitting you

4\) Keep unplugged and turned off when not in use.
