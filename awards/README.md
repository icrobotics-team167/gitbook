# üèÜ Awards

This chapter focuses on the awards available in FRC. The primary focus of this chapter is to provide resources for putting together the submitted awards; however, there are also brief overviews for the machine/creativity and team attribute awards. For more information on these please visit the FIRST Award Workbook [here](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource\_library/frc/game-and-season-info/awards/frc-award-workbook.pdf).
