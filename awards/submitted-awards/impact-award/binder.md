## **The Impact Binder**

The Impact Binder is an optional supplemental resource that teams may provide to judges during their Impact interview. It serves as a way to categorize, organize, and provide evidence of your outreach efforts. Since FIRST emphasizes evidence-based outreach, the binder helps validate and showcase your team’s impact.

### **What to Include in the Impact Binder**

**1. Table of Contents**

FIRST provides official documentation forms to help structure your binder. Each event should include:

* Event Name
* Location
* Date
* FIRST’s Official Definition of the event type
* Type of Documentation (e.g., photos, emails, thank-you cards)

#### **2. Outreach Event Sections**

Each outreach event should have its own page or section that includes:

* Description of the event
* Goals and impact
* Evidence (photos, testimonials, emails, media coverage, etc.)
