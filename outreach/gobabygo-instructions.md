# GoBabyGo Instructions

## Project Overview

**GoBabyGo** is a nationwide program that modifies battery-powered ride-on cars to provide mobility for children with disabilities. As a high school robotics team, this project lets you apply engineering skills to a real-world cause while giving back to your community.

## Materials Needed

#### Ride-On Car Base

* Fisher-Price Power Wheels or similar 6V or 12V ride-on toy
* Must be large enough for the child to sit upright comfortably

#### Electrical Components

* Large push-button switch (easily activated by hand, foot, or head)
* 12V battery (if upgrading or replacing)
* Inline fuse (15A–30A depending on motor)
* Toggle switch (optional, for caregiver shutoff)

#### Tools

* Screwdrivers
* Wire cutters/strippers
* Drill
* Soldering iron and solder (optional)
* Zip ties, Velcro straps, heat shrink tubing

#### Adaptation Materials

* PVC pipe (for supports or harness frame)
* Pool noodles (for padding and safety)
* Foam for seating support
* Velcro and fabric straps
* Hot glue, duct tape, zip ties

## Build Steps

#### 1. Choose a Car and Assess

* Select a suitable ride-on car based on child size and needs
* Test existing wiring and motor function

#### 2. Disassemble for Access

* Open the car body to access wiring and battery
* Remove or disable original foot pedal

#### 3. Install Activation Switch

* Replace the foot pedal wiring with a large, easily accessible push button
* Use a **Normally Open (NO)** switch
* Mount the button in a location accessible to the child
* Add an inline fuse for safety

#### 4. Add a Parent-Controlled Power Switch

* Wire a toggle switch in series as an on/off control for caregivers
* Optional: Use a wireless remote shutoff if available

#### 5. Build Seating and Support

* Use foam, straps, and padding to ensure upright and safe seating
* Use Velcro or screws for removable and adjustable support structures
* Do **not** glue or drill into the battery compartment or structural parts

#### 6. Add Safety Features

* Cover all hard surfaces and corners with padding
* Ensure speed is limited (typically <2 mph)
* Consider adding a soft harness or seatbelt if needed

#### 7. Test and Iterate

* Test the vehicle without the child first
* Verify motor performance and button reliability
* Conduct a test ride with caregivers present
* Adjust as needed

## Safety and Legal Considerations

* Always work under adult supervision
* Consult with physical/occupational therapists if possible
* Get signed parental/guardian consent before modifications
* Label all modified parts
* Document everything

## Extra Features (Optional)

* LED lights
* Sound buttons (horns/music)
* Remote control override
* Adjustable or modular seating for future use

## Working With Families and Therapists

* Listen closely to caregiver and therapist feedback
* Customize button placement and seat support as needed
* Offer post-delivery adjustments
* Communicate regularly

## Documentation

* Take photos before, during, and after the build
* Maintain a **modification log**
* Create a printed **user manual** for the family
  * Charging instructions
  * Button use
  * Safety tips

## Delivery Day

* Present the car in an accessible, open space
* Involve the whole team for a celebratory moment
* Provide final instructions to caregivers
* Take pictures and share (with permission)
