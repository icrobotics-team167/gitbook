# Mini Bots Workshops

**Introduction**\
Hosting a full week-long event can be difficult to coordinate and find volunteers for. Below are shortened timelines that can be used for smaller events at libraries, schools, or on weekends. Any LEGO challenge from the Junior Bots curriculum can be used for Mini Bots, but we prefer to do LEGO Sumo. More details on this challenge are provided below.

By collaborating with public libraries and programs such as Girl Scouts, we streamline the planning process. This reduces publicity and logistical overhead. However, the same publicity strategies from Junior Bots are effective for Mini Bots.

#### **Engineering Process Overview**

The Mini Bots camp follows a consistent engineering process that helps drive student engagement and success.

### **Sumo Challenge Overview**

In Junior Bots, the **LEGO Sumo** challenge incorporates everything students have learned during the camp. They combine sensors, programming, and gear ratios to build a powerful robot. This challenge is perfect because it doesn’t require advanced understanding of the EV3 bots but can be adapted for more experienced students.

#### **Objective of LEGO Sumo:**

* **Goal**: Push your opponent out of the ring or disable them by tipping the robot over.
* Students can build attachments like flippers, claws, and other features to give their robot an advantage.
* Some students may choose to add extra wheels or motors for additional power.

#### **Pre-Programmed vs. Custom Programming:**

* **1-Hour Camps**: Pre-programmed robots drive straight ahead, saving time for building.
* **3-Hour Camps**: Teams receive a basic program but can practice block coding to add enhancements like eyes, sounds, or effects.
* **1-Day Camps**: Teams program their robots themselves and use the color sensor.

### **Camp Timelines**

#### **1-Hour Camp**

**Objectives**: Plan, Create, Test\
This camp focuses on designing and testing attachments for the LEGO Sumo challenge. The base robot is pre-built, and the programming is already deployed.

**Key Activities:**

1. **Introduction & Task Explanation (0:00 - 5:00)**
   * Welcome and explain the goals of the camp and the FIRST/FRC program.
2. **Design Attachment (5:00 - 15:00)**
   * Students receive a pre-built base robot and design an attachment to complete the challenge.
3. **Building & Testing (15:00 - 35:00)**
   * Students build their attachments using an EV3 kit.
   * After building, they test their robot and make tweaks to improve performance.
4. **Competition (35:00 - 50:00)**
   * Students practice running the challenge, make final adjustments, and compete.
5. **Feedback & Clean-Up (50:00)**
   * Students fill out feedback forms about their experience.
   * Clean up the robots and prepare for departure.

#### **3-Hour Camp**

**Objectives**: Plan, Create, Test, Improve\
In this longer camp, students build the base robot themselves and design attachments to complete the challenge.

**Key Activities:**

1. **Introduction & Robot Building (0:00 - 50:00)**
   * Introduction to the camp and explanation of FIRST/FRC.
   * Students build the base robot using an EV3 kit.
2. **Designing Attachments (50:00 - 1:05:00)**
   * Students design attachments that will help complete the LEGO Sumo challenge.
3. **Building Attachments & Programming (1:05:00 - 1:30:00)**
   * Students build their attachments using an EV3 kit.
   * Learn how to program the robot using block code.
4. **Testing & Improving (1:30:00 - 2:15:00)**
   * Students practice running the challenge and make final tweaks.
   * After testing, students redesign and rebuild their attachments.
5. **Competition (2:15:00 - 2:40:00)**
   * Students compete in a second round of competition with their updated robots.
6. **Feedback & Clean-Up (2:40:00)**
   * Fill out feedback forms and clean up the robots.

#### **1-Day Camp**

**Objectives**: Research, Plan, Create, Test, Improve\
This full-day camp provides more time for exploration and learning through extended activities.

**Key Activities:**

1. **Introduction & Robot Building (0:00 - 50:00)**
   * Welcome and explain the goals of the camp and the FIRST/FRC program.
   * Students build the base robot using an EV3 kit.
2. **Block Coding Demonstration (50:00 - 1:00)**
   * Leaders demonstrate block coding and show the types of blocks used for programming the robot.
3. **Maze Navigation Challenge (1:00 - 2:00)**
   * Students are tasked with navigating their robot through a maze on the ground using the blocks they’ve learned.
4. **Lunch Break (2:00 - 2:30)**
   * A break to eat and refresh.
5. **Recess & Activities (2:30 - 3:00)**
   * Non-LEGO STEM activities or outdoor recess time.
6. **Color Sensor Demonstration & Line Follower Challenge (3:00 - 3:55)**
   * Leaders demonstrate how to use the color sensor with the robots.
   * Students then complete a line-follower challenge using the color sensor.
7. **Attachment Design (3:55 - 4:10)**
   * Students are given a task to design an attachment to complete the LEGO Sumo challenge.
8. **Building & Programming (4:10 - 4:35)**
   * Students build their attachments and learn to program the robot using block code.
9. **Testing & Final Adjustments (4:35 - 4:55)**
   * Students test their robot and make final tweaks before the competition.
10. **Competition & Final Round (4:55 - 5:20)**
    * Students compete in a second round of competition with their updated robots.
11. **Feedback & Clean-Up (5:40)**
    * Students fill out feedback forms and clean up their robots.
