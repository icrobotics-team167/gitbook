# Junior Bots Challenge

**Day 1: Introduction to FLL and Robot Design**

**Objective:** Introduce participants to FLL, its core values, and the basics of robot design and building.

* **Morning: FLL Introduction & Core Values**
  * **Welcome to FIRST LEGO League**: Introduction to FLL's mission and values. Discuss the competition structure (robot game, project, and core values).
  * **Core Values**: Discuss teamwork, discovery, and fun as part of FLL’s core values. Team-building exercises to reinforce collaboration.
* **Afternoon: Robot Design Basics**
  * **Introduction to Robot Design**: Overview of the robot design challenge. Focus on structural integrity, movement, and sensor integration.
  * **Building the Robot**: Start designing and building a robot using LEGO parts. Introduce basic motors, axles, beams, and sensors.
  * **Programming Introduction**: Introduction to the FLL robot programming environment (such as LEGO Mindstorms EV3 or Spike Prime). Create a basic program to control motor movement.
* **Evening Activity:** **Robot Functionality Challenge**: Program the robot to move forward, backward, and turn using basic motor control.

***

#### **Day 2: Programming, Sensors, and the Robot Game**

**Objective:** Dive into programming, sensor usage, and the FLL robot game challenges.

* **Morning: Advanced Programming Concepts**
  * **Programming Basics Recap**: Review robot movement and basic control using programming blocks (e.g., motor control, loops, waits).
  * **Using Sensors**: Introduce sensors such as color sensors, touch sensors, and ultrasonic sensors to the robot. Program the robot to use these sensors for more complex tasks (e.g., line following, obstacle avoidance).
* **Afternoon: Robot Game Practice**
  * **Understanding the Robot Game**: Introduction to the official FLL robot game rules. Discuss the different missions on the game mat and the scoring system.
  * **Mission-Based Programming**: Program the robot to complete simple missions on the FLL game mat using sensor input and motor control.
  * **Trial Run**: Test the robot in the competition area to simulate real game conditions.
* **Evening Activity:** **Robot Game Practice Round**: Set up the game mat and let teams run a practice round, testing out different missions and troubleshooting.

***

#### **Day 3: The FLL Project & Presentation Skills**

**Objective:** Begin working on the FLL Project and prepare for the presentation aspect of the competition.

* **Morning: Introduction to the FLL Project**
  * **Understanding the Project**: Introduction to the FLL project, which is based on real-world problems. Discuss the current year’s theme and mission.
  * **Brainstorming Ideas**: Team brainstorming session to identify a problem related to the theme. Begin researching and gathering information for the project.
  * **Project Planning**: Guide teams in creating a project plan, identifying research goals, and assigning tasks for the project.
* **Afternoon: Project Development**
  * **Designing the Solution**: Teams start developing their solution to the problem. Focus on innovation and practicality.
  * **Presentation Preparation**: Begin developing the team’s project presentation. Discuss the key components (problem, solution, innovation, and impact). Emphasize clear communication, creativity, and teamwork.
  * **Mock Presentations**: Each team practices their project presentation, with peer feedback for improvement.
* **Evening Activity:** **Team Building & Reflection**: Encourage teams to reflect on their project ideas and share thoughts on how to improve the presentation.

***

#### **Day 4: Competition Preparation and Final Practice**

**Objective:** Finalize the robot design, project presentation, and prepare for a mock competition.

* **Morning: Finalizing Robot Design & Programming**
  * **Robot Optimization**: Fine-tune the robot design. Focus on improving efficiency, accuracy, and speed for completing the missions.
  * **Mission Strategy**: Develop and refine strategies for completing the robot game missions. Decide on which missions the robot will focus on during the competition.
  * **Final Robot Testing**: Teams run final tests on their robot, ensuring it can reliably complete the missions.
* **Afternoon: Finalizing the Project Presentation**
  * **Project Refinement**: Final adjustments to the project presentation, with a focus on clarity and professionalism.
  * **Robot Game Simulation**: Set up a full competition simulation with timed runs and project presentations. Teams go through the full FLL competition experience, including robot game runs and presenting their project to mock judges.
* **Evening Activity:** **Mock Competition & Feedback**
  * **Competition Run-through**: Teams present their projects to coaches or mentors, run their robots on the game mat, and receive feedback.
  * **Award Ceremony**: Celebrate achievements and recognize outstanding teamwork, innovation, and effort. Encourage teams to keep up the excitement for the real competition.

***

#### **Materials Needed:**

* LEGO Mindstorms EV3 or Spike Prime kits.
* FLL Robot Game mats and mission models.
* Computers with FLL programming software (e.g., LEGO Mindstorms or Spike Prime software).
* FLL project resources (information about the season’s theme, research materials).
* Presentation materials (posters, slides, etc.).

***

#### **Key Outcomes:**

By the end of the camp, participants will have:

* Built and programmed a fully functional robot.
* Learned how to integrate sensors and optimize robot behavior.
* Developed a project based on a real-world problem.
* Gained experience in presenting and communicating their ideas effectively.
* Gained the confidence to participate in an FLL competition.
