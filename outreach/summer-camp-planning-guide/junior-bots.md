# Junior Bots

**Day 1: Introduction to Motors, Blocks, and Basic Programming**

**Objective:** Introduce participants to the basics of building and programming a robot using LEGO Technic parts and the EV3 system.

* **Morning: Introduction to Parts & Assembly**
  * **Parts Overview**: Beams, axles, pegs, and bricks.
  * **EV3 Brick and Programming Setup**: Introduction to the EV3 Brick (programmable brain and power station for the robot).
  * **Building a Simple Starter Bot**: Guide the campers through assembly using LEGO Technic parts (small motor, large motor).
* **Afternoon: Programming Fundamentals**
  * **EV3 Software**: Drag and drop blocks to create programs.
  * **Flow and Action Blocks**: Learn basic movement and speed control (forward, backward, turning).
  * **Motor and Wait Blocks**: Introduction to controlling motor movement and timing.
  * **Driving Forward Activity**: Program the robot to drive forward from the start line to the finish line.
  * **Stretch Goal**: Add functionality to turn around at the finish line and come back.
* **Evening Activity:** **Maze Challenge**: Program the robot to navigate a maze by controlling movement with the EV3 software.

#### **Day 2: Introduction to Sensors (Color & Touch)**

**Objective:** Learn to use sensors to enhance robot behavior (color sensor and touch sensor).

* **Morning: Color Sensor**
  * **Understanding the Color Sensor**: Measure light values (reflected and ambient light).
  * **Simple Color Sensor Bot**: Build a robot that uses the color sensor to react to different colors or light.
  * **Programming Challenge**: Program the robot to follow a colored line or detect ambient light.
* **Afternoon: Touch Sensor**
  * **Touch Sensor Basics**: React to being bumped, pressed, or released.
  * **Simple Touch Sensor Bot**: Program a basic bot to react to touch.
  * **Roomba Challenge**: Program a robot to navigate a maze using the touch sensor.
* **Evening Activity:** **Line Follower Challenge**: Program the robot to follow a black line using the color sensor.

#### **Day 3: Ultrasonic Sensors and Gears**

**Objective:** Learn how to use ultrasonic sensors and gears to add precision and functionality to the robot.

* **Morning: Ultrasonic Sensor**
  * **Understanding Ultrasonic Sensors**: Learn how the ultrasonic sensor detects distance by bouncing sound waves off objects.
  * **Conga Line Challenge**: Use ultrasonic sensors to create a conga line with multiple robots, avoiding collisions.
  * **Parallel Parking Challenge**: Program a robot to park in a tight space using the ultrasonic sensor.
* **Afternoon: Gears and Gear Mechanisms**
  * **How Gears Work**: Learn how gears affect the speed and direction of rotation.
  * **Robot Racing Challenge**: Use gears to create a robot that moves faster.
  * **Catch & Release Challenge**: Use a medium motor and gears to catch and release a cuboid.
* **Evening Activity:** **Robot Racing**: Set up a racing competition, with robots using gears to adjust speed.

***

#### **Day 4: Putting Everything to the Test**

**Objective:** Apply the skills learned over the camp in a competitive setting.

* **Morning: Sumo Challenge Preparation**
  * **Rules**: Push your opponent out of the ring, disable your opponent, stay within the ring, and use only two drive motors, two sensors, and no more than four wheels.
  * **Design & Build**: Create your Sumo bot with offensive attachments (flipper/claw).
* **Afternoon: Sumo Challenge**
  * **Competition**: Teams compete in a sumo-style battle where the goal is to push the opposing robot out of the ring or disable it.
* **Evening Activity:** **Closing Ceremony & Awards**
  * Reflection on skills learned.
  * Prizes or certificates for achievements (Best Robot Design, Best Program, Best Teamwork, etc.).

***

#### **Materials Needed:**

* LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Kits (with motors, sensors, beams, axles, and bricks).
* Computers with EV3 software installed.
* Color and touch sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and gears.
* Tables for building and workspace.
