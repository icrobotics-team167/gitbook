# Summer Camp Planning Guide

### 1. Identify Your Goals

Before jumping into logistics, use the following questions to help shape the foundation of your camp:

* Does a summer camp further your program’s mission and vision?
* Does your community already have STEM or robotics camps?
  * If so, how will yours provide different value?
  * Could you partner with or expand their existing program?
* What volunteer support do you have (adults and students)?
* What age range of campers are you targeting?
  * Different age groups require different learning approaches and energy levels.
* Do you have supplies or resources you can use?
  * Build your curriculum around what you have to reduce startup costs.
* Is your goal to provide a learning experience or raise money?
* What learning objectives do you want your campers to walk away with?

***

### 2. Establish Time Commitment & Cost

#### Research

* Look into local summer camp options from YMCAs, colleges, and rec programs.
* Reach out to local parent groups or schools for insight and marketing opportunities.
* Research scholarships in your area and understand average pricing.

#### Structure

* Many families prefer **more days with fewer hours** (e.g., 4 days of 6-hour camps).
* Volunteers tend to burn out with longer durations.

#### Cost Strategy

* Price competitively but align with your camp’s goals.
* Fundraising camps may be priced slightly higher, experience-based camps lower.

#### Cost Tips & Tricks

* Price camps with a 9 or 5 ending (e.g., $249 instead of $250).
* Younger student camps = higher volunteer needs = higher pricing.
* **Before/after care** add-ons:
  * Increases flexibility for busy families
  * Include low-effort activities like movies, board games, or STEM games
* Discounts for beta testers, siblings, or returning campers
* If including a take-home item:
  * Choose reusable items (shirts, drawstring bags, etc.)
  * Keep t-shirt designs **generic** to reuse leftovers
  * Change shirt **colors annually** or allow **tie-dye on Day 1**
* **Partner with other teams**:
  * Share volunteers, kits, or supplies
  * Document who is responsible for what if co-hosting with other FIRST teams

### 3. Determine Number of Campers

Start small and scale as your confidence grows. Consider volunteer ratios and location space.

#### Recommended Ratios

* **PreK–2nd Grade**: 1 counselor per 2–3 campers
* **3rd–6th Grade**: 1 counselor per 4–5 campers
* **7th–8th Grade**: 1 counselor per 8 campers

#### Adult Support

* One adult per classroom helps with logistics and parent communication.
* Adults assist with:
  * First aid
  * Behavior issues
  * Waivers and paperwork

### 4. Find a Location and Set Dates

Start your location search early to lock in a space that matches your camp size and needs. Consider:

* Schools, churches, community centers, or your team’s lab space
* Outdoor access for breaks or large activities
* Tables and seating for meals or hangouts
* Proximity to busy streets or hazards
* Fridge/microwave access
* Age-appropriate environment and security (fenced yards, visible exits)

#### Timing Considerations

* **June and August** are ideal for attendance
* Avoid **July** due to common vacation conflicts

***

### 5. Choose a Camp Topic

Choose a theme that aligns with your team’s goals and resources.

* Use available materials (e.g., LEGO kits, Spheros, etc.)
* No tech? No problem! Programming and science camps can use laptops or basic household materials
* Avoid large upfront investments your first year
* Establish clear **learning objectives** to guide lesson planning

***

### 6. Market Your Camp

Marketing is key to a successful camp. The earlier and more consistently you advertise, the better.

#### Promotion Tactics

* **Social Media**:
  * Post regularly starting at registration launch (every 1–2 weeks)
  * Share updates, photos, and reminders
  * Use local targeting tools on Facebook/Instagram
  * DM local schools, libraries, and STEM groups to help share
* **School Outreach**:
  * Contact local elementary/middle schools
  * Ask to share flyers via newsletters or bulletin boards
* **Community Posting**:
  * Post flyers in coffee shops, grocery stores, libraries, and community centers
* **Email Outreach**:
  * Reach out to past participants, event attendees, and sponsors
* **Camp Expos**:
  * Attend local summer camp expos to promote your camp in person

#### Timeline Tips

* Most camps open registration **January–February**
* Peak signups happen **February–March**
* Set your **registration deadline** early enough to order shirts and supplies

  * Attend any **Summer Camp Expos** in your area
* **May (before school ends)**: Confirm location and summer contact info
  * Send out **volunteer sign-up forms** and training materials
* **45 Days Before Camp**: Set registration cutoff to simplify planning
