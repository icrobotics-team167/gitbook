# Summer Camp Planning Guide

### **1. Identify Your Goals**

Start by asking key questions to define your camp’s purpose and structure. These will shape the rest of your planning process:

* **Does this camp support your program’s mission and vision?**
* **Are there similar STEM or robotics camps in your area?**
  * If yes, how can yours offer unique value or collaborate with existing ones?
* **What kind of volunteer support do you have?**
  * Consider both adults and student helpers.
* **What age range will your camp target?**
  * Different ages = different needs. Tailor activities accordingly.
* **Do you already have supplies or will you need to invest?**
  * Use existing materials where possible to reduce startup costs.
* **Is your goal educational, fundraising, or both?**
* **What are the learning outcomes you want campers to gain?**

***

### **2. Establish Time Commitment & Cost**

#### **Do Your Research**

* Check other local camps (YMCA, community centers, colleges) for:
  * Duration (days per week and hours per day)
  * Cost
  * Structure

> Parents prefer **more days with shorter hours**, but volunteers burn out if camps run too long. A common compromise is **4 days, 6 hours each**.

#### **Setting a Price**

* Compare against camps with similar instructional hours.
* Price to reflect your goals: low for accessibility, higher for fundraising.
* Look into scholarship programs or subsidized options in your area for benchmarks.

#### **Cost Tips & Tricks**

* End pricing in a **9 or 5** (e.g., $249 vs $250) – psychologically more appealing.
* Younger campers = more work = higher cost (don’t underprice).
* Offer **before/after care** for extra convenience (and profit).
* Consider incentives:
  * Sibling discounts
  * Returning camper specials
  * Early-bird pricing
* Will campers take something home? Budget for shirts, bags, etc.

***

### **3. Determine the Number of Campers**

#### **Start Small**

* It’s better to have a well-run, smaller first camp and grow from there.

#### **Counselor to Camper Ratios**

* **PreK–2nd:** 1 counselor per 2–3 campers
* **3rd–6th:** 1 counselor per 4–5 campers
* **7th–8th:** 1 counselor per 8 campers

#### **Don’t Forget Adult Support**

* Have at least one adult per classroom.
  * Roles: answer parent questions, handle first aid, registration, discipline.
  * Student counselors lead content but can lean on adults when needed.

***

### **4. Secure a Location & Dates**

#### **Find a Suitable Venue**

Look for locations that match your camper capacity and timing. Options include:

* Schools
* Churches
* Community centers
* Your team’s lab or makerspace

#### **Things to Consider**

* Outdoor space for breaks or large experiments
  * Is it fenced or safe from traffic?
  * Are there tables for lunch or downtime?
* Access to **kitchen appliances** (microwave, fridge)?
* How many campers can the space hold comfortably?
* Are there any **rules or restrictions** from the venue?

> **Best time to hold camp:** June or August\
> **Avoid July** due to family vacation season.

***

### **5. Choose a Camp Theme**

Select a topic that:

* Matches your **learning objectives**
* Aligns with your **available equipment** (e.g., LEGO kits, Spheros)
* Can be run with **minimal investment** if starting from scratch

**Tip:** For budget-friendly themes, consider:

* Programming with student laptops
* DIY science experiments using household items

***

### **6. Market Your Camp**

Once you’ve answered the 5 W’s (Who, What, Where, When, Why), it’s time to spread the word!

#### **Promotion Ideas**

* Flyers at local schools, libraries, coffee shops
* Social media (especially location-based Facebook ads)
* Community parent groups or local summer camp directories
* Contact participants from past events

#### **Timing Matters**

* Post camps between **January and February**
* Most registrations occur **February to early March**
* Set a registration deadline to give time for shirts, supply orders, and final logistics
