* First year costs include a LEGO Education SPIKE Prime kit, older EV3 or LEGO Mindstorm kits can also be purchased on eBay to reduce cost
* Engineering notebooks are optional and can easily be created in a regular notebook
* Many grants are available to teams through the FIRST website
* After the first year, FLL Challenge cost is roughly $350 per season
* Other costs to consider include t-shirts, snacks, and travel (should be minimal)

### Time Commitment

* Recommend a minimum of 2 hours per week from August until competition, many teams add practices the week or two prior to competition
* Not all students need to be at every practice - breaking the group into sub-teams can help efficiency and work around scheduling conflicts
* Local competition will be a half day event, typically on a Saturday from 8 am - 1 pm
* State competition is a full weekend day in January at Iowa State University

### Mentors

* Every team is required to have at least 2 coaches, no engineering or STEM experience required
* Find experts to help mentor or with research project by emailing community members, businesses, field “experts”, local HS student, etc
* This can also be a good source for sponsorship to help offset costs
