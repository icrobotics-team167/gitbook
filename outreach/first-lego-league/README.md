FLL Discover is for ages 4-6 (Grades PreK - 1) and is a guided education opportunity for children to learn basic STEM skills with hands-on activities in the classroom utilizing LEGO DUPLO bricks. Students meet roughly 10 times to learn about STEM through DUPLO building and finish their season with a celebration event showcasing their learning.
