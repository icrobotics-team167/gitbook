# Playoff Matches

Playoff matches function under a double elimination bracket. Included below.

If an alliance loses twice during playoffs, they are eliminated from the bracket. Between rounds there will be short breaks in which some awards will be presented to teams.&#x20;

Once 2 teams are left in the bracket, they compete in the finals. This functions under the best of 3 model. The first alliance to 2 victories will win the tournament.
