# Setup & Practice Matches

Some regionals have a preload day where teams can come in to set up their pits; during these days the pits will not be open and you cannot work on your robot, you can send in a small team to set up the pit and then leave the venue.&#x20;

The first day will have teams coming in, setting up pits, getting checked in, getting inspected, and then participating in practice matches. There will be a shorter schedule of practice matches that don't impact your record, but allow you to get practice competing on the field. Some regionals will have further practice matches for teams after the scheduled matches have completed. This will be filled using the queue line, where teams can fill in during practice matches during scheduled matches. To join the queue line, a team must have an inspected robot
