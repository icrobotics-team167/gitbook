# Alternative Fundraising Strategies

Sustainable funding is one of the biggest challenges FRC teams face. While corporate sponsorships and grant partnerships are essential, developing multiple revenue streams helps ensure long-term stability. This guide outlines real strategies used by successful teams—including our own—for raising money beyond traditional sponsorships.

#### **1. Grants**

**Recurring Opportunities**\
Each year, many FIRST partners and corporate supporters offer team grants—especially between mid-summer and mid-October. Stay up to date through the FIRST Grants Portal.

**Tips for Success**

* Save copies of past applications to use as templates
* Keep a team grant writing folder with common language, stats, and photos
* Involve students in drafting responses to teach writing, planning, and budgeting skills
* Use a **wishlist** at the beginning of the year—ranked by priority—to align asks with goals

**Stand Out by Being Specific**\
Companies value specificity. Instead of requesting “general support,” describe your actual goals:

* Covering robot registration
* Updating laptops for programming
* Purchasing safety glasses for pit crew\
  This shows purpose and planning—qualities funders look for.

#### **2. Fundraisers**

**Junior Bots Camp**\
One of our biggest fundraisers is a summer camp for elementary-age students. These camps are a win-win:

* Promote STEM to young students
* Build leadership skills for team members
* Generate significant team income

**Keys to Success**

* **Keep costs low:** Reuse supplies, use free public spaces, and market via word of mouth
* **Make it accessible:** Set a fair price that balances affordability with financial return
* **Involve students:** Assign roles like teaching, logistics, and registration

**Other Fundraisers We’ve Used:**

* **Concessions at University of Iowa events**
* **Restaurant fundraiser nights** (e.g., Pizza Ranch)
* **Lightbulb sales**—a fun and unusual way to raise funds
* **Future idea:** Launch a **fan merch store** with simple team-branded items (shirts, stickers)

**Tips:**

* Think about both active (camps, concessions) and passive (online stores, repeat sales) income streams
* Keep a calendar of events and rotate responsibilities among students

#### **3. Outreach as a Fundraising Tool**

**Make Outreach Count**\
While the primary purpose of outreach is to promote STEM and FIRST values, it can also lead to fundraising opportunities.

**How We Do It:**

* Display a **PayPal QR code** at events for instant donations
* Share success stories to encourage community support
* Mention that we’re a student-run nonprofit seeking to grow access to robotics

Most donations come from alumni, family friends, or people who’ve seen us at multiple events.

**Always Be Prepared:**

* Bring sponsorship brochures to every outreach
* Display a visual timeline or impact poster to build credibility
* Capture photos and testimonials for social media to increase visibility

#### **4. Community Support and Passive Income**

**Partnerships with Local Businesses**\
Even if a company can’t sponsor you, they might help in other ways:

* Hosting a donation jar at their counter
* Printing flyers at discount
* Providing snacks or pizza for camp days
* Offering a discount for team purchases (parts, tools, shirts)

**Passive Income Ideas**

* **Affiliate links** (with vendors you already use)
* **Community grants** from local clubs like Kiwanis or Rotary
* **Amazon Smile** (when it existed) or similar donation programs

#### **Final Tips for Alternative Fundraising**

* **Involve the whole team**: Business and non-tech students should lead here
* **Keep track**: Document what worked, what didn’t, and what to try next year
* **Tell stories**: People donate to causes, not just events. Focus on your mission and impact
* **Promote year-round**: Fundraising doesn’t have to stop in the fall
