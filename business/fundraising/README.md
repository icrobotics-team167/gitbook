# Fundraising

### Overview

Fundraising is essential to sustain and grow your robotics program. Roughly 20% of FRC teams struggle to maintain operational funding, but by using a structured, student-involved, mission-driven approach, your team can build sustainable support through grants, sponsorships, and strategic partnerships.\
\
This guide integrates:\
• Team-developed tools (master spreadsheet, student outreach, sponsorship packets)\
• Best practices from FIRST and experienced teams\
• Real-world strategies from advanced workshops and peer teams\
\
Special credit to FRC Team 4091, The Drift, for foundational insights including the DRIFT model, sponsor communication framework, and examples that shaped much of the structure and storytelling in this guide.

### 6 Steps to Fundraising Success

### 1. MISSION

Know your story. Share your purpose.\
\
Define and repeat your mission: what your team stands for and how it changes lives\
Use key phrases from your actual mission to keep messaging consistent\
For example: “We are developing the next generation of innovators and problem-solvers” – this is a core part of our program’s mission statement\
Incorporate impact videos and student stories in all outreach\
Highlight “more than robots” examples—students who pursue engineering, medical fields, or community leadership

### 2. COMMUNITY

Convert outreach into visibility and value.\
\
Treat outreach events as media opportunities\
Record videos, take photos, gather testimonials\
Post consistently on social media\
Share your impact: who you've reached, how you've helped\
Use impact videos as marketing assets\
Engage local media, school newsletters, and explore big ideas like a PBS-style documentary

### 3. PARTNERSHIPS

Think like a business. Connect your team to company goals.\
\
Align sponsorship proposals with CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) priorities\
Sustainability, education, youth development, equity\
Reach out to marketing departments instead of general contact forms\
Present your team as a brand partnership opportunity\
Use students’ interests and demographics to make personalized connections\
Example: Use or highlight brands your team already uses (e.g., Dewalt tools) to make alignment easy

### 4. RESOURCES

Use what you have to multiply your impact.\
\
Make fundraising resources required and accessible to all team members\
Sponsorship packet\
Brochure\
Business plan\
Grant template\
Standardize processes:\
Use consistent vendors (travel, parts, services)\
Think of your team as a client for long-term vendor discounts\
Partner with local students in film/media to help produce marketing videos

### 5. NETWORK

Keep sponsors connected and involved.\
\
Companies need a name and a face—include specific students in media and storytelling\
Use the DRIFT Model (developed by FRC 4091):\
• Discuss – students discuss and plan strategy\
• Research – students help draft messaging\
• Initiate – mentors finalize and send professional outreach\
• Follow-up – maintain active contact with touch points\
• Track – record all interactions and results\
\
Maintain 3 sponsor touch points throughout the year (also modeled by FRC 4091):\
• Start of season: We’re back, here’s our mission/plan\
• Mid-season: Progress report + reminder of donation deadline to maximize benefits\
• End of season: Results, impact video, and continued engagement opportunities

### 6. IMPACT

Data + Heart = Real Influence\
\
Pair success metrics with human stories in all communications\
Number of outreach events, hours volunteered, new members, scholarships\
Transformative experiences (e.g., a student going to Stanford for biomedical engineering)\
Use impact to secure future grants, grow sponsor support, and inspire the community

### Tools & Tactics

### Master Spreadsheet

Tracks every company contacted:\
\
• Sponsor status (Active, Interested, Declined, Inactive)\
• Contact details\
• Application method & deadline\
• Sponsorship history\
• Follow-up notes\
\
Students choose 1–2 companies each fall to contact and track using this sheet.\
They pick the method (email, phone, in-person) and manage follow-ups.

### Sponsorship Packet

A complete set of materials to hand out or send:\
\
• Letter: Personalized, includes thanks and request for renewed or new support\
• Brochure: Visual overview of FIRST, the team, and your funding needs\
• Business Plan: Detailed look at structure, leadership, budget, and long-term strategy\
\
Tips:\
• Hang brochures in public places (coffee shops, schools, libraries)\
• Reuse core materials year-to-year with minor updates

### Business Plan Must-Haves

• Mission & team history\
• Leadership structure (student and adult)\
• Board of directors (for 501(c)(3))\
• Sustainability plan\
• Strategic planning tool (see below)\
• Implementation roadmap\
• Budget, sponsor tiers, and benefits

### Strategic Planning: From SWOT to Barriers & Bridges

In the past, our team used SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) for internal reflection and goal setting. This remains a valuable tool, especially for teams early in their strategic planning journey.\
\
However, we’ve since adopted the Barriers & Bridges Protocol, inspired by FRC 321 RoboLancers’ award-winning impact methodology.\
\
Why the Shift?\
• Mission-driven: Keeps activities aligned with core purpose\
• Responsive: Encourages teams to adapt based on changing needs\
• Inclusive: Builds strategy by consulting with students and community\
• Actionable: Results in specific plans—not vague hopes\
\
How It Works\
Identify Barriers:\
• Why isn’t your mission fully realized yet?\
• Ask students, families, mentors, and community partners for input\
• Avoid assumptions—get real answers\
\
Design Bridges:\
• For each barrier, develop clear, actionable solutions\
• Use existing resources or find new ones\
• Collaborate with your audience to co-create sustainable efforts\
\
Example: If low attendance at workshops is a barrier, a bridge might include changing time slots, offering remote access, or coordinating carpools or buses\
\
Stay on Mission:\
• Every activity should move you closer to your goal\
• Revisit barriers/bridges throughout the season to adapt as needs shift\
• Keep all planning tied to your mission statement\
\
This model has helped us turn outreach and fundraising into intentional, long-term impact.

### Sponsor Benefits Ideas

• Logo on robot, shirts, pit banner, website\
• Social media posts\
• Quarterly newsletters (or 3 touch points)\
• “Lunch & Learn” robot demos at their offices\
• Custom thank-you plaques with FRC season/year\
• Personal impact video featuring the company’s role

### Expanded Sponsor Tiers & Benefits Strategy

Creating sponsor tiers helps companies clearly understand the value of their contribution and motivates higher levels of giving through meaningful recognition. Here's how to structure and implement sponsor tiers effectively.\
\
Step 1: Define Tier Levels\
• Create 3–5 distinct levels (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Partner)\
• Base tiers on donation amount or value of in-kind contribution (e.g., tools, services, meals)\
• Use round and memorable amounts (e.g., $250, $500, $1,000, $2,500+)\
\
Example Tier Levels\
• Bronze ($250+): Name on website & thank-you post\
• Silver ($500+): Name/logo on robot or shirts\
• Gold ($1,000+): Logo on pit banner + newsletter\
• Platinum ($2,500+): Mention in video + office demo\
• Partner ($5,000+): Annual plaque, co-branded outreach\
\
Step 2: Match Recognition to Tier\
• Provide visible, meaningful benefits\
• Offer invites, video features, recognition plaques\
\
Step 3: Promote the Tiers Consistently\
• Share tier structure in all sponsor materials\
• Include it in sponsorship packets, brochures, and your website\
\
Step 4: Maintain Transparency and Consistency\
• Keep sponsor details updated in your master spreadsheet\
• Deliver all promised benefits and follow through\
• Send thank-you messages and seasonal updates

### Final Notes

• Encourage hands-on participation in every part of fundraising\
• Advertise all aspects of the team: mechanical, media, business, leadership, etc.\
• Keep everything student-driven but coach-aligned for consistency\
• Consider recruiting a film student to help with polished promotional and impact videos
