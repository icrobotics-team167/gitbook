# ðŸ“‹ Team Administration

## Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive foundation for starting, managing, and sustaining a successful FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team. Whether you're a rookie team or looking to grow your impact, use this as a reference for best practices, tools, and key areas of team development.

## Team Structure and Leadership

#### Key Roles

* **Lead Mentor**: Oversees all team activities, communicates with FIRST HQ, ensures safety
* **Technical Mentors**: Guide students in mechanical, electrical, and programming areas
* **Student Leadership**: Team captain, subteam leads (build, programming, outreach, etc.)
* **Parents and Volunteers**: Logistics, meals, transportation, and fundraising support

#### Organization Tips

* Hold regular team meetings with a clear agenda
* Use a team charter or handbook to outline expectations and policies
* Create subteams (mechanical, electrical, programming, business, media, etc.)

## Preseason Planning

#### Recruitment

* Host interest meetings at school
* Present in classrooms and local events
* Welcome all studentsâ€”technical and non-technical

#### Training

* Conduct workshops on tools, CAD, programming, and safety
* Encourage students to learn leadership and project management skills

#### Fundraising

* Apply for FIRST and sponsor grants
* Seek local business sponsorships
* Organize community fundraisers (car washes, dinners, etc.)

## Build Season Essentials

#### Timeline

* Kickoff in January: Analyze game, strategize, prototype
* Weeks 1-3: Design, build drivetrain and mechanisms
* Weeks 4-6: Refine, test, and drive practice
* Stop build at competition or transport time

#### Project Management

* Use tools like Trello, Notion, or Monday for task tracking
* Daily stand-ups to align progress
* Document everything (designs, code, test results)

## Competition Preparation

#### Robot Transport and Packing

* Checklist for tools, pit display, batteries, chargers, and spares
* Practice loading and unloading

#### Scouting and Strategy

* Develop a paper or digital scouting system
* Assign roles for drive team, pit crew, scouts, and strategy

#### Team Spirit

* Create team branding (shirts, banners, buttons)
* Cheer on alliance partners and be respectful to all teams

## Outreach and Impact

#### Community Involvement

* Mentor younger teams (FLL, FTC)
* Host demos at schools and community centers
* Participate in parades, STEM nights, and public events

#### Awards

* Focus on Impact Award, Engineering Inspiration, and Judgesâ€™ Awards
* Keep documentation of all outreach and team growth
* Involve students in writing and presenting submissions

## Sustainability

#### Finances

* Build an annual budget
* Track income and expenses
* Set long-term goals for growth and travel

#### Mentorship

* Recruit and retain adult mentors
* Develop returning alumni as technical or leadership mentors

#### Knowledge Transfer

* Maintain engineering notebooks or team wiki
* Host end-of-season retrospectives and summer training
