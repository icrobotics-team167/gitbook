# Git

Git is, by _**far**_, the most powerful tool in a programmer's arsenal. It is a command line tool that allows you to do a lot of things with your code, including but not limited to:

* Track changes to code
* Allow you to work on certain parts of the code without impacting known good code or messing with other people's work
* Revert changes to code in case something breaks
* Automatically merge different sets of changes so that you (mostly) don't have to do it yourself

This chapter will get you started on the basics of Git.
