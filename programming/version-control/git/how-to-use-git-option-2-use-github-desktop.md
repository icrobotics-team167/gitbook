# How to use Git (Option 2): Use GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is a piece of software that puts all the functionality of git in a nice graphical user interface, and does all the hard parts of typing in commands for us.

### Installing GitHub Desktop

On a Windows, MacOS, or Linux computer, (Sorry but no Chromebooks) go to [the official page for GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), and click on the big purple Download button. From there, open the installer and follow the installer's directions. Once you have it installed, log into your GitHub account.
