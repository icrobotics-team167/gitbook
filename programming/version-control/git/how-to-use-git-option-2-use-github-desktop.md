# How to use Git (Option 2): Use GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is a piece of software that puts all the functionality of git in a nice graphical user interface, and does all the hard parts of typing in commands for us.

### Installing GitHub Desktop

On a Windows, MacOS, or Linux computer, (Sorry but no Chromebooks) go to [the official page for GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), and click on the big purple Download button. From there, open the installer and follow the installer's directions. Once you have it installed, log into your GitHub account.

### Getting a Repository

Projects in git are managed using what are called repository, (repos for short) and repos are where all the files and changes are tracked. You can get a repo from 2 ways:

1. Cloning an existing repo
2. Making a new repo

If your team already has an existing repo for your robot code, clone a repo. Click on File -> Clone Repository, and select the repo that you want. If you don't see it, ask to be added to your team's GitHub organization.

If you are making a new repo, click on File -> New Repository and select the folder in which you want to make the repo in.

### Using GitHub Desktop

The UI for GitHub Desktop looks something like this, once you clone a repository:
